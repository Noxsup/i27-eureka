# configure sonar into our pipeline

* Create/ setup our own sonar server
* or we can create an account in sonarcloud and perform the same operations

* Why ?
    * it helps in detecting the areas in the code that needs refactoraction or simplification. it will be acting as code quality check 

    * this helps in finding bugs in early stage like dev, so we can fix in at that particular stage only
